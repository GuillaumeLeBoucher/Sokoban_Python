# Sokoban_Python
This repository contains a Python project that we have to do in my first year at ENSTA Bretagne. It is a pyhon implementing game call Sokoban.

Sokoban is a type of puzzle video game, in which the player pushes crates or boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. 

RULES GAME : 

The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor or a wall. Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations.

The player is confined to the board, and may move horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the square beyond. Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they cannot be pulled. The number of boxes is equal to the number of storage locations. The puzzle is solved when all boxes are at storage location

In order to launch our game, you have to launch the Python script called Main.py.

Once the Main.py has been started, you can choose to either play or edit using the GUI.
However, we did not have time to put an order "Back to the main menu", so it will take
restart the Main.py script to access the other part of the program.

In each of the games (Game or Edition), you can find in the menu the rules specific to our game and our graphical interface. Please consult them before starting the game.

Thanks and good game !

PS : We did not create specific folders for each part of the project, so it's a little messy.
